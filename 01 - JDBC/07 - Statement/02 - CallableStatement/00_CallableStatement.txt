CallableStatement
-----------------
- CallableStatement is an interface provided by the JDBC API that allows Java applications to execute 
  SQL stored procedures and functions in a relational database.
- It extends the 'PreparedStatement' interface, adding methods to handle the input and output parameters
  of stored procedures.
- Syntax 
	{call procedure_name(?, ?, ...)}
	
Stored Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- These are pre-compiled collections of SQL statement stored in the database.
- They can perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
- It is basically used to perform business logic.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~
- This is similar to Stored procedures but typically return a single value and can be used in SQL 
  expressions.
- It is basically used to perform calculation.

Summary
~~~~~~~
- CallableStatement is used to execute stored procedures and functions in a database.
- It supports input, output, and input-output parameters.
- Syntax for stored procedures is {call procedure_name(?, ?, ...)}.
- It offers methods to set and retrieve parameters, register output parameters, and execute the procedure.
- Advantages include better performance, maintainability, and security.
- Example usage involves connecting to the database, setting parameters, executing the procedure, and 
  retrieving results.
