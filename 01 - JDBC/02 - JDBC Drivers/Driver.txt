JDBC Driver
-----------
- A JDBC driver is a software component that enables Java application to interact
  with databases.
- It translates Java calls to database-specific calls, Thus allowing Java programs
  to exicute SQL queries and retrive result.
- There are 4 types of JDBC drivers:-
            Type-1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
            Type-2: Native-API Driver(Partial Java Driver)
            Type-3: Network Protocol Driver(Fully Java Driver)
            Type-4: Thin Driver(Pure Java Driver)


Type-1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The Type-1 driver translate JDBC calls into ODBC(Open Database Connection) calls, 
  and then used the ODBC driver to communicate with the database.
- It requires an ODBC driver to be installed on the client machine.

Advantages:
- Allow access to almost any database since ODBC is widely supported.
- Can be useful fo testing purposes when no other driver is available.

Disadvantages:
- Performance is relatively slow due to overhead of the translation process.
- Depend on native ODBC drivers, which reduce Portability.
- Not suitable for production environment.

Example usage:
Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:DataSourceName", "user", "password");


Type-2: Native-API Driver(Partial Java Driver)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The Type-2 driver convert, JDBC calls into database-specific calls using native libraries 
  provided by the database vendor.
- Requires native database libraries on the client machine.

Advantages:
- Performance is better that Type-1 since it reduce ODBC overhead.
- Can take advantage of database-specific features provided by native libraries.

Disadvantages:
- Requires native library installation on the client, making it less portable.
- Each database requires a specific Type-2 driver.

Example Usage:
Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe", "user", "password");


Type-3: Network Protocol Driver(Fully Java Driver)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The Type-3 driver uses a three-tier approach where JDBC calls are sent to a middle-tier 
  server(application server), which then ktranslates these calls to database-specific calls.
- The middle-tier server handles the communication with the database.

Advantages:
- Completely written in Java, which makes it platform-independent.
- No need for database vendor-specific libraries on the client machine.
- Can connect to multiple databases using a single driver.

Disadvantages:
- Performance can be affected by network latency due to the additional network round-trip 
  to the middleware server.
- Requires a middleware server setup, which can add complexity.

Example Usage:
Class.forName("com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver");
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:db2://server:port/database", "user", "password");


Type-4: Thin Driver(Pure Java Driver)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The Type-4 driver converts JDBC calls directly into the database-specific protocol.
- It communicates directly with the database using the database's proprietary protocol.

Advantages:
- Completely written in Java, making it platform-independent. 
- Offers the best performance as it eliminates the need for native libraries and middleware servers.
- Easier to deploy and maintain.

Disadvantages:
- Database-specific, meaning each database requires its own Type-4 driver.

Example Usage:
Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dbname", "user", "password");
