ResultSetMetaData
-----------------
- ResultSetMetaData is an interface in JDBC that provides metadata about the columns in
  a 'ResultSet', including the column names, types, sizes, and other properties.
- It allows you to programmatically access and analyze the structure of the result set
  obtained from a database query, facilitating dynamic handling and processing of query 
  results.
