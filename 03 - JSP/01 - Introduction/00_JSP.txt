JavaServer Pages
----------------
- JavaServer Pages(JSP) is a technology used for creating dynamic web pages using Java.
- It allows developers to embed Java code in HTML to produce dynamic contend.
- JSP pages are compiled into servlets, which handle HTTP request and generate HTML responses.
- This This approach helps separate the presentation layer from business logic, simplifying 
  web development and maintenance.
- In simple words, JSP is the part of the Java EE(Enterprise Edition) platform and is designed 
  to simplify the creation of web applications by separating the user interface from business
  logic.
 
Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~
    ● Separation of presentation and logic.
    ● Custom tags and libraries.
    ● Scalability and performance(Compiled once).


How JSP Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1> Request processing:
	- When a user requests a JSP page, the server checks if the JSP page has been compiled into 
	  a servlet.
	- If not, the server compiles the JSP page into a servlet(a Java class) and then loads and 
	  execute this servlet.
	  
2> Servlet Execution:
	- The compiled servlet process the request and generates the HTML response.
	- This servlet code handles dynamic content generation and interact with other serever-side
	  components if necessary.
	  
3> Response Delivery:
	- The generated HTML response is sent back to the user's browser, where it is rendered as a 
	  web page.
