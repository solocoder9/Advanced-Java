Lifecycle of a JSP Page
-----------------------
1> Translation Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	● Description: The JSP file is translated into a servlet by the JSP engine.
	● Purpose: Converts JSP syntax into Java servlet code.
	● Key Point: This step happens once unless the JSP file is modified.

2> Compilation Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	● Description: The generated servlet is compiled into bytecode.
	● Purpose: Transforms the servlet into an executable .class file.
	● Key Point: Compilation occurs after translation and is only done when the JSP changes.
	
3> Loading and Initialization Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	● Description: The servlet class is loaded by the servlet container, and its init() method is called.
	● Purpose: Initializes the servlet for handling requests.
	● Key Point: init() is executed only once when the servlet is loaded.

4> Request Processing Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	● Description: The JSP handles client requests via the service() method.
	● Purpose: Processes requests like GET, POST, etc., and generates dynamic content.
	● Key Point: Each request triggers the service() method to be executed.

5> Destroy Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	● Description: The destroy() method is called when the JSP is removed from memory.
	● Purpose: Cleanup resources before shutting down the JSP instance.
	● Key Point: This method is called once when the JSP is being destroyed.



Summary:
--------
- The JSP lifecycle involves five phases: Translation, Compilation, Loading & Initialization, Request Processing, 
  and Destruction.
- The lifecycle follows the same pattern as servlets, with JSPs being converted into servlets behind the scenes.
