Handling Request and Responses using request and response objects
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- In JSP, request and response objects are used to handle HTTP requests and responses between the 
client (browser) and the server.

● Request Object: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Used to retrieve data sent from the client, such as form data or URL parameters.
- Essential method of request objects:
	○ getParameter(String name): Retrieves form data or URL query string parameter.
	○ getAttribute(String name): Retrieves attributes stored in the request.
	○ getMethod(): Returns the HTTP method (GET/POST) used in the request.
	  
● Response Object: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Used to send data back to the client, such as HTML content or redirection instructions.
- Essential method to response objects:
	○ setContentType(String type): Sets the content type of the response.
	○ sendRedirect(String location): Redirects the client to another resource (JSP, servlet, or 
	  external URL).
	○ getWriter(): Returns a PrintWriter object to send text response to the client.
