Expression Language(EL) in JSP
------------------------------
- Expression Language (EL) is a feature in JSP that simplifies accessing data stored in JavaBeans, 
  request attributes, session attributes, and other objects without using complex Java code. 
- It allows developers to write more concise and readable JSP code.

Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~
● Simplifies JSP Code: Reduces the need for scriptlets, resulting in cleaner, more readable JSP pages.

● Easy Data Access: Makes accessing attributes and JavaBeans properties straightforward.

● Expression Evaluation: Enables powerful expression evaluation directly within the JSP pages.


Key Features
------------
1> Implicit Objects: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- EL provides access to implicit objects, making it easier to retrieve common attributes. 
- Some important implicit objects:
	● pageScope: Access attributes stored in the page scope.
	● requestScope: Access attributes stored in the request scope.
	● sessionScope: Access attributes stored in the session scope.
	● applicationScope: Access attributes stored in the application scope.
	
2> Syntax: 
~~~~~~~~~~~
- EL uses ${expression} to access variables and evaluate expressions. 
- For example:
	${username}

3> Operators: 
- EL supports operators for:
	● Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
	● Logical (&&, ||, !)
	● Relational (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
	● Empty check (empty)
	
4> Accessing Beans: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- EL allows direct access to JavaBeans properties. 
- For example, if there is a bean with a name property:
	${user.name}
	
5> Functions: 
~~~~~~~~~~
- EL supports calling static functions from custom tag libraries (JSTL). 
- For example:
	${fn:length(username)}
