Annotations
-----------
- In Java, annotations are metadata that can be attached to various elements of a program, such as
  classes, methods, and fields, to provide information to the compiler or to influence the behavior 
  of the code at runtime.
- Annotations enables cleaner, more modular code by reducing the need for boiler plate and 
  configurations files.
- There are two types of annotations in java:
		1> Built-in Annotations(Ex:- @Override, @Deprecated...)
		2> Meta-Annotations(Ex:- @Retention, @Target, @Inherited...)
