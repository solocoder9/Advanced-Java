How a Servlet application works
-------------------------------
- When a user enters a URL in the browser, the web container (e.g., Tomcat) creates two objects: request and response. 
  The container then calls the service() method of the servlet, passing these request and response objects. The 
  service() method determines the type of HTTP request (like GET or POST) and forwards the request to the appropriate 
  method (e.g., doGet(), doPost()). Based on the logic in those methods, the servlet processes the request and 
  generates a response, which is sent back to the client and displayed in the web browser window.

- After the response is sent, the request and response objects are no longer needed. The servlet container marks these 
  objects for garbage collection. The Java Garbage Collector eventually reclaims the memory occupied by these objects 
  when it runs, freeing up resources.
