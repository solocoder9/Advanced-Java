RequestDispatcher
-----------------
- RequestDispatcher is an interface in the Java Servlet API that allow a sevlet to forward a request
  to another resource(like another servlet, JSP, HTML page) or to include the content of another 
  resource in the response.
- It is used to request delegation and resource inclusion within the same server context.
  
Common Methods of RequestDispatcher
-----------------------------------
1> Forwarding Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	● Method: forward(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)
	- Description: Forwards the request to another resource (e.g., servlet, JSP). The browser is unaware 
      of this internal forwarding, and the URL in the address bar remains unchanged.
    - Example:-
    	RequestDispatcher dispatcher = req.getRequestDispatcher("/anotherServlet");
		dispatcher.forward(req, res);
    	
2> Including Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	● Method: include(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)
	- Description: Includes the content of another resource (like a JSP or another servlet) in the 
	  response of the current servlet. The response from both resources is combined.
	- Example:-
		RequestDispatcher dispatcher = req.getRequestDispatcher("/header.jsp");
		dispatcher.include(req, res);
