1) What is JDBC?
- JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity.
- It is a Java API(Application Programming Interface) that allows Java programs to 
  access and manipulate data stored in databases, enabling developers to execute 
  SQL queries, ritrieve results, and perform database operations programmatically.
- In essens, JDBC acts as a bridge between Java applications and various database
  management systems, facilitating seamless interaction and data exchange.

2) Why we need JDBC?
- JDBC is a crucial component for Java applications that interact with relational 
  databases.
- It provides a standardized, efficient, and easy-to-use API for database operations,
  ensuring that applications are portable, scalabel, and maintainable.
- Wheter building small web applications or large enterprise systems, JDBC remains a
  foundational technology for database connectivity in the Java ecosystem.

Advantages
----------
1> Portability:
- JDBC allows Java applications to work with different databases without altering
  the codebase.
2> Security:
- It offeres suceure access to databases through authentication and authorization 
  mechanisms.
3> Performance:
- JDBC optimizes database operations for efficient data retrival and manipulation.
4> Integration:
- It supports large datasets and high trasnaction volumes, making it suitable for
  enterprise-level applications.
5> Integration:
- JDBC seamlessly intergrates with other Jva technologies and frameworks, enhancing 
  application development capabilityes. 
6> Flexibility:
- Developers can impliment various database operations like querying, updating, and 
  deleting data with ease.

Benefits
--------
1> Improved Data Access: 
- JDBC facilitates easy and efficient access to databases, enabling seamless interaction
  with data.
2> Enhanced Productivity: 
- By providing a standardized interface, JDBC simplifies database-related tasks, reducing 
  development time and effort.
3> Reliability: 
- JDBC ensures reliable and consistent database connectivity, contributing to the stability 
  of Java applications.
4> Cost-Efficiency: 
- Utilizing JDBC eliminates the need for proprietary database drivers, reducing licensing 
  costs and promoting cost-effective development.
5> Interoperability: 
- JDBC promotes interoperability between Java applications and various database systems, 
  fostering compatibility and flexibility.
6> Real-time Data Processing: 
- With JDBC, applications can process data in real-time, enabling timely decision-making and 
  action.
7> Streamlined Development: 
- JDBC streamlines the development process by providing built-in features for database access, 
  simplifying application development
