DatabaseMetaData
----------------
- Database metadata in JDBC is a set of information about the database itself, provided through 
  a DatabaseMetaData object. 
- This metadata includes details about the database’s structure, capabilities, and features, such 
  as information about tables, columns, data types, and database-specific functionalities. 
- It helps developers create flexible and adaptable code by providing insights into the database’s 
  structure and features, enabling support for multiple database types without specific adjustments.
