Batch Processing in JDBC
------------------------
- Batch processing in JDBC is a feature that allows the execution of multiple SQL statements 
  as a single batch. 
- This is particularly useful for executing a large number of similar queries, such as bulk 
  inserts, updates, or deletes, in an efficient manner. 
- Batch processing minimizes the number of database round-trips, thereby improving the 
  performance of the application.

Key Concepts
------------
1> Batching:
~~~~~~~~~~~
- The process of grouping multiple SQL statements into a batch and sending them to the database 
  in one go.
- This reduces the number of database calls, which is beneficial for performance, especially when 
  dealing with a large number of operations.

2> Add to Batch:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- SQL statements are added to the batch using the addBatch() method of either Statement, 
  PreparedStatement, or CallableStatement.

3> Execute Batch:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The batch of statements is executed with a single call to the executeBatch() method.
- The method returns an array of update counts, where each count corresponds to the number of rows 
  affected by each SQL statement in the batch.

4> Batch Size:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Some JDBC drivers or databases have limitations on the maximum batch size. Itâ€™s important to check 
  and adhere to these limitations to avoid errors.

5> Error Handling:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- If an error occurs during batch processing, it might result in a partial execution of the batch. 
- Proper error handling and transaction management are necessary to ensure data integrity.
