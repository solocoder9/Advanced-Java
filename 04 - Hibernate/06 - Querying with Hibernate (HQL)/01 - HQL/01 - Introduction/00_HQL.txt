Hibernate Query Language (HQL)
------------------------------
- HQL is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL but operates on entity objects
  and their properties, not on database tables directly.
- It is case-insensitive for keyword (SELECT, FROM), but class and property names are 
  case-sensitive.

Basic Syntax of HQL 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- HQL queries are written using entity class names, not table names.
- HQL supports SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
- Example:
    SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.salary > :minSalary

    ● Employee: Entity class.
    ● e.salary: Class field, not the database column.
    ● :minSalary: Parameterized input (named parameter).

Common HQL Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  AVG(), SUM(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN().
