Pagination in Hibernate
-----------------------
- Pagination is the process of dividing a large set of data into smaller, manageable 
  parts (pages) to avoid loading all the records at once, which could lead to 
  performance issues. 
- Instead of loading all rows from a database, only a subset (or a single page) of rows 
  is retrieved at a time.
- Pagination is important in applications where the database might have millions of rows, 
  and retrieving all of them at once could slow down the system.

Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~
● Performance optimization
● Better user experience
● Efficient database querying

Key Points
~~~~~~~~~~
- In Hibernate, pagination is implemented using the Query interface, specifically by setting:
    1. First Result: The starting position of the first result (setFirstResult()).
    2. Max Results: The maximum number of results per page (setMaxResults()). 

Key Methods for Pagination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● setFirstResult(int startPosition): Specifies the starting row (zero-based index).
● setMaxResults(int pageSize): Specifies the maximum number of records (page size) to retrieve.
