Cascading in Hibernate
----------------------
- Cascading in Hibernate refers to the mechanism that allows you to propagate certain 
  operations (like save, update, delete, etc.) from a parent entity to its associated 
  child entities automatically. 
- This feature simplifies the management of relationships in an object-oriented way, 
  ensuring that related entities are handled correctly without requiring explicit 
  code for each operation.

Types of Cascading operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Cascade Type      | Description                                                   |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| ALL               | Applies all cascade operations (persist, merge, remove,       |
|                   | refresh, detach).                                             |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| PERSIST           | Cascade the persist operation to associated entities.         |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| MERGE             | Cascade the merge operation to associated entities.           |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| REMOVE            | Cascade the remove operation to associated entities.          |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| REFRESH           | Cascade the refresh operation to associated entities.         |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| DETACH            | Cascade the detach operation to associated entities.          |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| CLEAR             | Clear the associated entities.                                |

Example:-
~~~~~~~~~
- Consider a one-to-many relationship between Department and Employee entities. 
- If you want to save a department along with its employees, you can use the 
  CascadeType.PERSIST:
