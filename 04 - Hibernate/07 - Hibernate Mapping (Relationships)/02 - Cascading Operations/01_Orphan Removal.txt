Orphan Removal
--------------
- Orphan removal is a specific cascading operation that automatically deletes child 
  entities when they are removed from the parent entity’s collection. 
- This feature helps in maintaining database integrity and automatically handles 
  orphaned records.

Example:-
~~~~~~~~~
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    private Set<Employee> employees = new HashSet<>();

    ● With orphanRemoval = true, if you remove an Employee from the employees collection
      of a Department, that Employee will be deleted from the database automatically.
