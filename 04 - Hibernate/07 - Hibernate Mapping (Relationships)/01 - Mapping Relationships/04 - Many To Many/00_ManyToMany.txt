Many-to-Many Relationship
-------------------------
- A Many-to-Many relationship means that multiple instances of one entity can be associated
  with multiple instances of another entity.
- This type of relationship is often modeled through a join table.
- Examples:
  - Students and courses (a student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students).
  - Authors and books (an author can write multiple books, and a book can have multiple authors).
