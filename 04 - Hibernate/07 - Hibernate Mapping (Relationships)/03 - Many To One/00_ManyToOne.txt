Many-to-One Relationship
-------------------------
- A Many-to-One relationship means that multiple instances of one entity are associated 
  with a single instance of another entity.
- This type of relationship is common when multiple records in one table point to a 
  single record in another table.
- Examples:
    Multiple students belonging to a single school.
    Multiple orders placed by a single customer.
