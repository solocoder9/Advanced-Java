Annotations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
● @OneToOne – used on both sides (either bidirectional or unidirectional).
● @JoinColumn – defines the foreign key column in a unidirectional relationship.
● @MapsId – in some cases where the primary key is shared between the two entities.

Key Points
~~~~~~~~~~
● Unidirectional: One side owns the relationship and uses @JoinColumn.
● Bidirectional: Both sides are aware of the relationship (using mappedBy).
● Cascading: Use CascadeType.ALL to save/delete related entities together.
