Isolation Levels in Hibernate
-----------------------------
- Isolation levels defines how database transactions are isolated from each other, ensuring
  data integrity and consistency when multiple transaction run concurrently.
- They prevent issues like dirty reads, not-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
- There are 4 standard isolation levels:
        1. Read Uncommitted
        2. Read Committed
        3. Repeatable Read
        4. Serializable

1. Read Uncommitted:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Allow transactions to read uncommitted changes made by other transactions (dirty reads).
- Least strict, but prone to data inconsistency.

2. Read Committed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- A transaction can only read data committed by other transactions.
- Prevents dirty reads but allows not-repeatable reads (data can change between reads).

3. Repeatable Read:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Ensures that if a transaction read data, it will see the same data throughout its execution
  (prevents non-repeatable reads).

4. Serializable:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The strictest isolation level, ensuring complete isolation.
- Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads by locking rows or even tables.


■ Key Concepts
--------------
● Dirty Read:
    - Reading uncommitted changes; potential for invalid data.
● Non-Repeatable Read: 
    - Seeing different data on repeated reads of the same record due to committed changes by 
      another transaction.
● Phantom Read: 
    - Seeing a different number of records (new or missing rows) when querying the same data set 
      due to inserts/deletes by another transaction.
