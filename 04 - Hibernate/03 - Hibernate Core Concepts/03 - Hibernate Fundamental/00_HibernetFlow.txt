Hibernate Fundamental Flow
--------------------------
1. Load Configuration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Load the Hibernate configuration file (hibernate.cfg.xml), which contains database connection 
  settings and mapping details.

2. Create SessionFactory:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Create a SessionFactory instance from the configuration. The SessionFactory is thread-safe and 
  serves as a factory for creating Session instances.

3. Create Session:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Open a Session from the SessionFactory. The Session is not thread-safe, so it should be used 
  within a single thread for CRUD operations.

4. Begin Transaction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Start a transaction using the Session instance. This groups multiple operations into a single
  atomic unit of work.

5. Perform CRUD Operations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Use the Session instance to perform CRUD operations (e.g., save, update, delete).
  example, session.save(emp) to save an Employee object.

6. Commit Transaction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Call commit() on the Transaction instance to make all changes permanent in the database. 
  If any errors occur, you can also roll back the transaction to maintain data integrity.

7. Close Session and SessionFactory:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Close the Session to release resources.
● Finally, close the SessionFactory to avoid resource leaks and free up database connections.
