Object-Relational Mapping(ORM)
------------------------------
- ORM is a programming technique that enables developers to interact with a relational database using 
  object-oriented programming principles. 
- It simplifies database operations by allowing you to work with data as objects, rather than writing 
  raw SQL queries. 
- This abstraction helps manage database interactions more efficiently and enhances code maintainability.

Key Benefits of ORM:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Reduces the need for SQL code.
- Automatically maps database tables to object classes.
- Provides features like caching and lazy loading.
- Facilitates database independence.

Common ORM Frameworks: Hibernate, JPA, Entity Framework.
